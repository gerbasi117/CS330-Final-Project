# CS330-Final-Project

1. How do I approach designing software?
**What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?**
This project helped me improve my ability to plan and implement complex 3D scenes by focusing on modularity and reusability. I learned to break down large tasks, such as rendering objects and implementing physics, into smaller, manageable components. Additionally, I honed my skills in applying textures, transparency, and lighting to make the scene visually compelling.

**What design process did you follow for your project work?**
I started with conceptualizing the layout and functionality of the 3D scene, ensuring that each component served a purpose. Then, I transitioned into iterative design by continuously testing and refining the code. This process involved balancing visual appeal, functionality, and technical feasibility.

**How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?**
The modular design tactics I used can be applied to future projects, ensuring code clarity and maintainability. The iterative approach will also help in continuously improving functionality and debugging effectively in other software development tasks.

2. How do I approach developing programs?
**What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?**
I implemented modular functions to handle specific tasks, such as updating brick states and handling collisions. This ensured that each part of the program was independent, making it easier to debug and extend. I also focused on detailed commenting to document the logic behind each function.

**How did iteration factor into your development?**
Iteration was a crucial part of my development process. After implementing each feature, I tested its functionality and adjusted parameters, such as transparency levels, collision effects, and physics rules, to achieve the desired outcome. This iterative testing and refinement cycle was essential to completing the project successfully.

**How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the project's completion?**
Over the milestones, my approach evolved from simple implementation to a more structured and methodical process. I began prioritizing code organization, reusability, and clarity. By the end of the project, I could efficiently manage complex interactions, such as circle and brick collisions, while maintaining a clean and logical codebase.

3. How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
**How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?**
Computational graphics have taught me the importance of combining technical skills with creativity. By working on this project, I gained hands-on experience with 3D rendering, physics simulation, and collision mechanics, which can be applied to fields like game design, animation, and simulation development in my educational journey.

**How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?**
Professionally, these skills provide a foundation for careers in software development, particularly in areas like virtual reality, augmented reality, and game design. Understanding how to create interactive and visually engaging environments equips me to contribute to industries that rely on cutting-edge graphical applications. These skills also enhance my ability to think critically and solve problems, which are valuable in any professional context.
